Time? Should I be using a timestep to simulate the passage of time or be using real time?

Shift management! Decided to break vehicles into shifts, according to their ID.

Overcomplicating the network...had to scrap original and restart.

Front migration(migrating asap) has 0 completed jobs after 2 weeks. After many days/hours of troubleshooting and debugging, I've come to the conclusion that the network strain makes this solution not viable.
